Hello! I am Kavel, or Kav, and I draw from time to time.

## Why Kavel Babble?
I created this website to be a little cove to post my art and salient thoughts about art and art philosophy, and maybe life stuff from time to time.
I chose to create a website instead of using conventional platforms (Twitter, Instagram, Artstation) because I am not looking for discoverability or engagement.
It's not that these things are bad; they can just be a burden when my sole focus is to draw.

In her [YouTube short](https://youtube.com/shorts/-tRNKBYQ7Vo?si=7KZdd_tMRiM6x74r) about how much she makes as an artist, Pikat comments on how YouTube is a full-time job, which leaves you with very little extra time to *actually* be a freelance artist.
I don’t want to spend my time being a social media manager; I want to spend my time drawing.

## Why Drawing?
I originally wanted to pick up drawing because I wanted a hobby that I sucked at.
This sounds weird and kind of egotistical, but it’s true.
I decided I had grown too comfortable in my existing hobbies (gaming, calisthenics, and video making) at the end of Freshman year of college, so I started looking for another hobby.
While on the toilet for an inordinate amount of time scrolling through Instagram reels, I saw a video about [Drawabox](https://drawabox.com/).
Later that summer, I picked up Drawabox, and the rest is history.

As I began to draw more and more (warming up to the [50% rule](https://drawabox.com/lesson/0/2/50percent)), I started to realize how easily I could express myself.
Each line was dictated by my intent (and a healthy amount of human error), which completely changed the substance of a piece.
Rather quickly, my pursuit of a difficult hobby turned into a love of expression.

This is generally where I am at now- I draw because it helps me express myself.
The act of drawing is meditative and provides me with a break from the world.
The things I create, whether “ugly” or “nice”, are pieces of me at a time.

Drawing has introduced me to some amazing communities, people, philosophies, and whatever other plural noun I can stuff here.
It undeniably improved my life, and I am excited to see what is to come.

## What Drawing?
My favorite areas of drawing are Character Design, Creature Design, Comics, and Animation.
I don’t really have any big aspirational goals for any of these categories- I just hope to make some cool stuff for each of these someday.

## How Drawing?
I originally attempted to learn to draw when I was about 12-ish years old.
This “attempt” composed following character drawing tutorials, drawing the same furry head repeatedly until I got too frustrated to continue, and copying a Udemy “eye drawing” art tutorial.
I would not consider this a legitimate attempt.

Throughout the rest of middle and high school, most of my drawing experience would be relocated to engineering drawing and sketches.

I would consider my “true” start to drawing mid June of 2023 when I first started Drawabox. Ideally, I’ll complete Drawabox Lessons 1-7 (including the challenges) and continue to [NMA](https://www.nma.art/) or [Proko](https://www.proko.com/).

## Who Drawing?
I’ll make a blog post about [art parents](https://www.proko.com/community/topics/art-parents) some time, but here are some of my favorite artists that I draw inspiration from (shortened):
- [Taran Fiddler](https://www.artstation.com/tfiddlerart)
- [Ryoko Kui](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryoko_Kui)
- [Kurumi Stormpen](https://x.com/kurumistormpen)

## Conclusion
Thanks for reading this all, I’m not the most concise person.
I hope to be good about posting and updating here, but we’ll see.
At least I set the domain to auto-renew, so you can stare at this page until something else happens.
Bye for now!
